# A Game - Simple Third Person Webbrowser Game

**This is a simple third Person Game called "A Game" that I created as a Final Project while attending my certification Course in Web Development at the Digital Career Institute.**

## Technologies
- NextJS
- ThreeJS
- React-Three-Fiber
- React-Three-Drei
- Rapier Physics
- Blender

## Functionality
- You can run through the World with the W, A, S, D Keys and you can rotate the character by using your mouse.
- You can search and collect different Scroll Items which are placed thoughout the world.
- When you collected all the 5 loot items the level is completed and a completion info pops up.

## Learnings
Though it was a project based on web development technologies we learned throughout the certification-course, I nonetheless chose this specific task to create a Game, because all the used technologies like ThreeJs, its react-three-libraries and the Physics Engine weren't tought but I had to learn them for myself to build up this result. 

So it really helped me not only to get a rudimentary understanding in how games are built, but the real learning was how to do research on my own and create things when it comes to technologies or logics that I am not familiar with and what I need to do to understand and implement new technologies into a given project.
